## ðŸ“– About
Inspired by the game Flappy Bird, PROJECT R.O.C.K.T is an endless 2D pixel-art game where you traverse through different kinds of obstacles. Since dodging alone is very boring (just kidding), you are also given a chance to fight back using your missles to either destroy obstacles or incapacitate enemies.
